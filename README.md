# little-lemon final Capstone project by Guillaume Michaud

For Meta Android Dev Cetificate
I've used Pixel 2 XL Emulator API32.
Since Android Studio Flamingo is now by default on Material3 and a lot of changes happend I've downgraded to the old 2. Please don't upgrade the graddle or it will break the code.
